        <h2>Moving About In Space</h2>
        <p>Every action you take takes time, which is measured in turns and subturns.  There are 100 subturns in a turn, and after each turn the enemy agents move to
            another sector.  Many actions also run some risk of attracting suspicion and increasing your "heat" level.   These actions are always modified by the
            Federation influence of the Planet or System you're currently at, but also can be modified by other factors as well.  Here is a table of some common actions
            you can take and how many subturns they require, as well as how much risk they pose of Federal Detection: </p>

        <h2>Obtaining Fuel</h2>
        <p>
            Fuel may be obtained by scooping at Stars, recharging on planets which offer that service, and also via piracy.  When scooping, the type
            of star as well and the level of your photonic convertor determines how much fuel each scoop yields.   Here is a chart of the various star
            types:

        <h2>Emergency Warps</h2>
        <p>
            You start the game with two emergency warp devices, which, when activated, will materialize you and your ship in a random system somewhere in the galaxy.
            Emergency warping costs 72 units of energy to operate, and if you activate it with less than the required amount your ship may take significant damage and
            possibly explode.
